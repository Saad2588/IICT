<p style = "font-size : 32px">I don't know what to talk about I am typing random things in order to just fill in the space. I would like to say something but what? The <b> ship of thesus </b> ( i don't know the spelling ) is a ship famous for its philosophical question inducing behaviour (what did i just say). If you replace each plank of the ship in order to repair it, is it even the <i>ship of thesus</i> you are left with in the end? I think im gonna end this paragraph writing scheme and just copy and paste from here on out. </p>
